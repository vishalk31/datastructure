# datastructure
Great! If you're planning to keep **questions and answers in a separate Jupyter Notebook**, here's how you can organize your `README.md` file to reflect that structure. This version assumes you'll upload one notebook (e.g. `data_structures.ipynb`) that contains **Q\&A style problems** for Python data structures.

# 🐍 Python Data Structures – Questions and Answers

This repository contains Python data structure problems and solutions that I’m learning and practicing.

All the questions and answers are organized inside a **Jupyter Notebook** for easy reading, running, and experimenting.

---

## 📓 Notebook Contents

The notebook includes Q&A-style problems for:

- Lists
- Tuples
- Dictionaries
- Sets
- Stacks and Queues
- Linked Lists (basic implementation)
- Trees (basic traversal)
- HashMaps / Counters
- Basic Algorithms (sorting, searching)
- Practice exercises

## 📌 Example Format in Notebook

```python
# Q1. Reverse a list without using reverse()

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(my_list[::-1])
````

```python
# Q2. Find the frequency of each element in a list

from collections import Counter
nums = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]
print(Counter(nums))
```

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-data-structures.git
```

2. Open the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook data_structures.ipynb
```

## 🌱 Why this repo?

This is my personal learning log for mastering data structures in Python.
I'm solving and documenting each problem with clean, simple explanations.
